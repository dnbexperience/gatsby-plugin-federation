# Gatsby Plugin for enabling Module Federation

This Plugin enables Webpack Module Federation, without any sidecar or special solutions.

## 🌟 Show your support

Please, give [this Plugin](https://github.com/tujoworker/gatsby-plugin-federation) a **start** on GitHub 🙏

## ⚡️ Features

- Makes it possible to share React Components from different Gatsby builds.
- Share your styles, data stores, modules, components and dependencies.
- Supports fetching of shared parts during build time (SSG).
- Allows distributed deployments of federated applications.
- Supports develop and production mode.

### 🔥 Run the example

- clone this repo and run `yarn install`
- run Gatsby in development: `yarn start`
- or make a build: `yarn build && yarn serve`
- and visit http://localhost:8001/ and http://localhost:8002/

## 🚀 How to use

Install `yarn add gatsby-plugin-federation` and add it to your `gatsby-config.ts` file:

```js
// gatsby-config.ts
export default {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-federation',
      options: {
        ssr: true, // Remotes will be fetched during SSG (SSR)
        federationConfig: {
          // A. For your Remote
          name: 'myRemote',
          exposes: {
            './Button': './src/components/RemoteButton',
          },

          // B. For your Host
          name: 'myHost',
          remotes: {
            remote: 'remote@http://localhost:8002/', // where the content of /public is served
          },

          shared: {}, // Your shared deps
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Check out the possible `federationConfig` [options](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-federation-plugin/).

> 👉 **Note:** If you use (.js) `gatsby-config.js` – then you need to use `module.exports = ` instead of `export default`.

### Importing federated modules or components

This Plugins comes with a HOC to simplify the imports for federated components.

#### Method 1

```jsx
import { Dynamic } from 'gatsby-plugin-federation'

const RemoteModule = Dynamic(() => import('remote/Button'))

render(<RemoteModule fallback={<>Loading...</>} your-props />)
```

#### Method 2

You can use the React lazy method to import shared components as well:

```jsx
const RemoteModule = React.lazy(() => import('remote/Button'))

const DynamicWrapper = () => {
  if (!globalThis.MF_SSR && typeof document === 'undefined') {
    return <>loading...</>
  }
  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback={<>Loading...</>}>
      <RemoteModule />
    </React.Suspense>
  )
}

render(<DynamicWrapper />)
```

## Requirements

This plugin requires at least:

- Gatsby v4+ (Webpack v5)
- React v17+

## Credits

A big thanks to [Zack Jackson](https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy) for originally coming up with Module Federation.

## How this Plugin works

It adds async boundaries to the entry files and changes some settings in the Webpack config so the Module Federation Webpack Plugin works without throwing an error.

### Development of this Plugin

This package is using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) – so please follow the commit message decoration principles.

- e.g. run a build in watch mode (re-build on file changes): `yarn watch:all`
- e.g. run a command just on host or remote: `yarn workspace host start`
- e.g. run build the TypeScript on file changes: `yarn workspace gatsby-plugin-federation watch`
- e.g. run the tests like on the CI: `yarn workspace e2e test:ci`
- e.g. run the tests in watch mode: `yarn workspace e2e test:watch` (you would need to run the projects in either development or production first)
